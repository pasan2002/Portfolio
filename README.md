# Portfolio

This is a portfolio website I created to practice React, NodeJS, MongoDB and Express.


## Documentation
You can clone my github repo to your machine. If you want to publish it with your own information you have to add some files to it first.

1. First you have to  clone project into your machine and open it from your favourite code editor (I use vscode). Then in your terminal type this code. 


## Install nodemodules

Install all npm packages for client side

```bash
  cd client
  npm install
```

Install all npm packages for server side

```bash
  cd server
  npm install
```
    

2. Now create a new file and name it as .env. Then add your mongoDB url, JWT secret, JWT lifetime. cloudinary cloud name, cloudinary api key and cloudinary api secret.


## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`MONGO_URI` = your mongodb url

`JWT_SECRET` = your jwt secret

`JWT_LIFETIME` = lifetime of your JWT token

`CLOUD_NAME` = name of your cloudinary cloud

`API_KEY` = api key of your cloudinary 

`API_SECRET` = api secret of your cloudinary



2. Now create a new file and name it as .env. Then add your mongoDB url, JWT secret, JWT lifetime. cloudinary cloud name, cloudinary api key and cloudinary api secret.


3. Now add your images to hero and history folders and you have to update image names in history.json. You have to add your own information to other fields of that two json files.
