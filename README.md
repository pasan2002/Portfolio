This is a portfolio website I created to practice React, NodeJS, MongoDB and Express.


## Documentation
You can clone my github repo to your machine. If you want to publish it with your own information you have to add some files to it first.

## Install nodemodules

Install all npm packages for client side

```bash
  cd client
  npm install
```

Install all npm packages for server side

```bash
  cd server
  npm install
```
    

2. Now create a new file and name it as .env. Then add your mongoDB url, JWT secret, JWT lifetime. cloudinary cloud name, cloudinary api key and cloudinary api secret.


## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file
